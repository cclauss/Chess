###################################################################################################################

# file syntax:
# each todo line is begun with a 'T' followed by either a 'S' or a 'P'
# 'S' is for 'suggestion'
# 'P' is for planned
# 'P' will be followed by a number; this is the priority of the implementation
# with 0 being the most important (the higher the number, the less important)
# if the line is begun with a 'D', it has been done.

#DTP0: coords & board
#DTP0: pieces
#DTP1: piece move validation
# TP1: checkmate detection
# TP2: GUI
# TP4: GitHub repo
# TS: AI
